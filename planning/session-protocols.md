# First Aid Kit Lite - Session Management Protocols

## Overview

This document defines the standardized protocols for managing development sessions to ensure continuity, context preservation, and efficient progress tracking across multiple work sessions.

## Session Start Protocol

### ‚úÖ Pre-Session Checklist

Execute these steps at the beginning of each development session:

1. **[ ] Read CLAUDE.md file completely**
   - Review any critical updates or changes
   - Check for new development guidelines
   - Note any environment-specific instructions
   - Location: `./CLAUDE.md`

2. **[ ] Read SESSION_STATUS.md for current status and continue marker**
   - Look for the üî¥ **CONTINUE HERE** marker
   - Review what was completed in the last session
   - Check for any blocking issues or dependencies
   - Note the current phase and sprint status
   - Location: `./SESSION_STATUS.md`

3. **[ ] Check .claude/settings.local.json for duplicate permissions**
   - Review permission list for duplicates
   - Clean up any redundant entries if found
   - Ensure permissions align with current development needs
   - Location: `./.claude/settings.local.json`

4. **[ ] Read planning/current-sprint.md for Phase 2 production tasks**
   - Review current sprint objectives
   - Check task priorities and dependencies
   - Note any deadline or milestone information
   - Update task assignments if needed
   - Location: `./planning/current-sprint.md`

5. **[ ] Check Serena Memory for project context**
   - Use `mcp__serena__list_memories` to see available memories
   - Read relevant memories with `mcp__serena__read_memory`
   - Focus on memories related to current work phase
   - Update understanding of project status and decisions

6. **[ ] Review recent git commit history**
   - Check last 5-10 commits for recent changes
   - Understand what was implemented recently
   - Note any potential merge conflicts or issues
   - Command: `git log --oneline -10`

7. **[ ] Verify development environment**
   - Ensure all required tools are available
   - Check that dependencies are installed
   - Verify build process is working
   - Test that application starts without errors

### Session Start Commands

```bash
# Quick status check
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Environment verification
npm list --depth=0
npm run dev # Should start without errors

# Check for any pending issues
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

    - Ensure backup and continuity for next session
    - Command: `git push origin main`
    - Verify push was successful

### Session End Commands

```bash
# Final status check
git status
git diff --staged

# Commit session work
git add .
git commit -m "Session $(date +%Y-%m-%d): [describe work completed]"

## Memory Management Guidelines

### What to Store in Serena Memory

- **Project Architecture Decisions**: Key architectural choices and rationale
- **Implementation Patterns**: Successful code patterns and approaches
- **Security Considerations**: Important security decisions and implementations
- **Performance Insights**: Optimization techniques and benchmark results
- **Integration Details**: How different components work together
- **Error Resolution**: Solutions to complex problems encountered

### Memory Naming Conventions

- `project-architecture-[date]` - Architecture decisions and patterns
- `security-implementation-[date]` - Security-related implementations
- `powershell-integration-[date]` - PowerShell-specific implementation details
- `ui-patterns-[date]` - React/UI implementation patterns
- `performance-optimizations-[date]` - Performance improvements
- `troubleshooting-[date]` - Common issues and solutions

### Sample Memory Content

```markdown
# PowerShell Integration Implementation

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Phase**: PowerShell Integration
**Key Decision**: Use child_process instead of node-powershell

## Architecture Decision

Chose to use Node.js child_process.spawn() instead of node-powershell package because:
1. Better control over execution environment
2. More reliable error handling
3. Better resource management
4. Active maintenance and security updates

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
const executeScript = async (scriptPath: string, params: string[]): Promise<ExecutionResult> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const process = spawn('powershell.exe', ['-ExecutionPolicy', 'Bypass', '-File', scriptPath, ...params]);
    // Implementation details...
  });
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Always validate script paths
- Sanitize all parameters
- Run with minimal privileges
- Implement timeout mechanisms
- Log all execution attempts
```

## Troubleshooting Common Session Issues

### Git Issues

**Problem**: Merge conflicts after pulling changes
```bash
# Resolution
git status
git diff
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

**Problem**: Uncommitted changes blocking git operations
```bash
# Resolution
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
# Resolve any conflicts
```

### Development Environment Issues

**Problem**: npm dependencies out of sync
```bash
# Resolution
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors
```bash
# Resolution
npm run type-check
# Fix reported errors
npm run build
```

### Electron Issues

**Problem**: Protocol handlers not working
```bash
# Resolution
# Check Windows registry
reg query "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\first-aid-kit"
# Re-register if necessary
```
