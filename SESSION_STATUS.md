### Session January 9, 2025 - Foundation Complete
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive planning directory structure
- ‚úÖ Developed detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ‚úÖ Designed complete technical architecture  
- ‚úÖ Created implementation phases with 24-day timeline
- ‚úÖ Established session management protocols

- ‚úÖ Configured TailwindCSS and PostCSS pipeline
- ‚úÖ Created secure IPC bridge with preload script
- ‚úÖ Built basic React app with placeholder UI
- ‚úÖ Tested application successfully - fully functional

### Key Decisions Made
- **Technology Stack**: Electron + React TypeScript + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
- **PowerShell Integration**: Use child_process.spawn() instead of node-powershell for better control
- **Security Approach**: Strict context isolation with secure IPC bridge
- **Database**: SQLite for logging and settings storage
- **Protocol Handlers**: Both first-aid-kit:// and fak:// protocols
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN components for consistent, professional interface

### Issues and Blockers

## Next Session Priorities

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore for Node.js/Electron
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Create Electron project structure with React TypeScript
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Set up basic folder structure per architecture document
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Install core dependencies (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, etc.)
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Configure development build process

## Important Notes

### Development Environment
- Working Directory: `P:\Projects-Not-On-Cloud\FAKL`
- Platform: Windows 11
- Node.js and npm should be available
- PowerShell integration will be Windows-specific

### Security Considerations
- All PowerShell execution must be sandboxed
- Protocol handlers need proper input validation
- Never expose Node.js APIs directly to renderer process
- Implement comprehensive logging for audit trails

### Architecture Decisions
- Main/Renderer process separation for security
- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- ShadCN UI for professional, accessible components
- SQLite for local data storage
- Winston for structured logging
